# Project-4

Members: Anthony Palacio, Osamu Adler, Sergio Basurto, and Michahel Diaz 

Purpose: Our project focuses on creating a movie reccomendation tool using Machine-Learning (ML) techniques to optimize reccomendations to users based on preferered interests, likes, and generes. 

With the plethora of streaming services that exist such as AmazonPrime, HBOMax, Hulu, and of course Netflix, the overwhelming amount of titles can lead to users of these platforms often choosing a movie based on that plaatform's reccomendations.  However, those platforms can only base their reccomendations on what users have previosuly consumed. With users having many different interests and with different movies exisitng solely on certain platforms, this archaic habit creates an oversight with many great movies and reccomendations being left out. Our ML tool looks to fix that pain point by allowing users to get their base reccomendations from over 1 million titles based on preferences according to genre, era, and actors.
